# Initial implementation validation

Recorded September 28, 2026 UTC (September 27 local time), on Linux x86-64/NixOS with Rust 1.95.0. These checks cover this implementation's explicit subsets and regressions. They do not establish full web compatibility, production security, or Chromium performance parity.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Pass |
| `cargo clippy --locked --offline --all-targets -- -D warnings` | Pass |
| `cargo test --locked --offline -- --include-ignored` | 149 passed, none failed or ignored |
| `cargo build --locked --offline --release` | Both browser and stress binaries built |
| `python3 tools/reftest.py --binary target/release/eris-browser` | 10/10 exact pixel comparisons passed |
| `timeout 180s target/release/eris-stress 5000` | 15,000 generated cases, zero caught panics or invariant failures |
| `python3 -m py_compile tools/benchmark.py tools/reftest.py tools/run.py` | Pass |
| `./run.sh --window-screenshot artifacts/window-final.png --exit-after 5` | Native window opened, framebuffer captured, exit status 0 |
| HTTPS render of `https://example.com` | PNG produced, exit status 0 |
| HTTPS load of `https://expired.badssl.com` | Rejected with expired-certificate error, exit status 1 |
| HTTPS load of `https://self-signed.badssl.com` | Rejected with unknown-issuer error, exit status 1 |

The Rust suite contains 100 library tests, 20 browser/editor tests, one executable integration test, 10 loopback HTTP tests, and 18 pipeline tests. It includes POST body/redirect behavior, MIME and origin restrictions, compressed-body limits, text decoding, inert content, disabled controls, DOM mutation, event cancellation, resource-limit termination, clipping, stale worker results, editing acknowledgements, and fragment navigation. Loopback tests require permission to bind temporary local sockets.

Reference fixtures cover box geometry, cascade/inheritance, flex, grid and fractional tracks, hidden content, preformatted text, table spacing, media/custom properties, and overflow clipping. Both sides use the same rasterizer; shared defects can go undetected. No upstream WPT or Test262 pass rate is claimed.

The deterministic mutation run used seed `0xe2152026` and at most 8 KiB per generated input. Of 5,000 script samples, 622 were accepted and 4,378 rejected; of 5,000 SVG samples, 3,252 were accepted and 1,748 rejected. Rejections are expected for malformed or unsupported input. The largest generated DOM had 272 nodes. This is a small mutation smoke test, not broad adversarial coverage, coverage-guided fuzzing, or an audit.

Native and headless output for the home page, forms, gallery, and a narrow viewport was visually inspected. Native clipboard contents were not read during validation. Windows and macOS were not validated.

The [performance record](PERFORMANCE.md) defines the measured phases and includes three fixture timings. There was no Chromium comparison. The [compatibility inventory](COMPATIBILITY.md) and [security boundary](SECURITY.md) list material unfulfilled requirements, including missing platform APIs and the absence of OS process isolation.
