# Development docket

The goal remains an independent, fully web-compatible Rust browser with a
defensible security boundary and measured performance within the requested
Chromium threshold. The current implementation does not satisfy that goal;
[compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md), [security](SECURITY.md), and
[validation](VALIDATION.md) track concrete coverage and gaps.

## Vulkan rendering backend

Requested for future implementation on September 28, 2026. Add a custom Vulkan
backend for rasterization and compositing, with the following acceptance work:

- Define a backend interface for the existing validated display list and image
  resources, preserving clipping, fixed coordinates, text coverage, alpha and
  nested opacity behavior.
- Bound GPU allocations, command work, uploads and retained resources. Decide
  the GPU process/driver boundary explicitly; GPU access must not broaden the
  renderer's filesystem or network authority.
- Handle synchronization, resizing, surface loss, device loss and resource
  cleanup. Keep the software renderer available for comparison and fallback.
- Compare supported output against independent pixel references and the
  software renderer. Record justified rasterization tolerances explicitly.
- Measure equivalent workloads, including upload/synchronization/presentation
  costs, memory and frame latency. Vulkan alone does not establish a Chromium
  performance result.

Vulkan is planned, not implemented. Driver requirements, platform coverage and
the Rust Vulkan binding have not been selected. Ongoing standards and security
work continues alongside preparation for this backend.
